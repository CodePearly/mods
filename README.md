# The Best Performance (and Quality-of-Life) Mods for Minecraft
This is the most up-to-date list of the mods that I personally use while playing Minecraft. From tripling performance to revamped menus, these mods improve your gameplay experience without changing vanilla gameplay.
If you see an ❌ next to a version (eg: "1.19.4 ❌"), that means that the mod is not updated for that version (as far as I know). If there is a ✔, it is updated.

## Notices
* I have listed required mods, meaning I've only listed mods that another mod will ***need*** for the game to start
* Some of these mods will require Mod Menu to be configured. If you still can't configure a mod after installing Mod Menu, install Cloth Config API
* If you're using Sodium and you get a crash (or another weird bug) that is caused by another mod, install Indium and that will hopefully fix it (ex. Continuity uses the Fabric Rendering API, so it requires Indium to work with Sodium)

## You must install [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org) to run these mods

## Different Types of Mods
* Performance
  * Performance mods make your game run better and smoother like increasing your frame rate or making chunks load faster
* Quality-of-life
  * Quality-of-life mods make the Minecraft experience better overall, like always displaying coordinates in game or copying screenshots to your computer's clipboard for easy access
* Dependency
  * Dependency mods are mods that are really only used to make other mods work, like how most mods require Fabric API/Quilted Fabric API to run, even though the mod doesn't do anything to the game on its own

### Note about CurseForge links: The website has been in a situation around mod re-uploads, and the website should be avoided when possible. Mods that are still only available on CurseForge now have been marked as so. You can learn more about the situation in [this video by TheMisterEpic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Ka86KKka4).
