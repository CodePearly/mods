# The Best Performance (and Quality-of-Life) Mods for Minecraft
This is the most up-to-date list of the mods that I personally use while playing Minecraft. From tripling performance to revamped menus, these mods improve your gameplay experience without changing vanilla gameplay.

If you see an ❌ next to a version (eg: "1.19.4 ❌"), that means that the mod is not updated for that version (as far as I know). If there is a ✔, it is updated.

### Note about CurseForge links: The website has been in a situation around mod re-uploads, and the website should be avoided when possible. Mods that are still only available on CurseForge now have been marked as so. You can learn more about the situation in [this video by TheMisterEpic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Ka86KKka4).
